(**
    This module defines relations and provides operations over them.

    Relations are sets of tuples of the same length. Currently,
    relations are implemented using the
    {{:http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Set.html}Set}
    module from the standard library. (The ordering of tuples is given
    by the {!Tuple.compare} function, hence it's lexicographic.)

    This module has an unnamed perspective of relations. Hence,
    columns are identified by their position (from 0 to the number of
    columns minus 1). On the contrary, the {!module:Table} module has
    a named perspective and therein columns are identified by
    attributes.

val make_relation: tuple list -> relation
  (** Builds a relation from a list of tuples. *)


val map: (tuple -> tuple) -> relation -> relation
  (** [map f rel] returns the relation formed by those tuples [f t]
      with [t] in [rel]. *)

val natural_join: (tuple -> tuple option) -> (int * int) list -> relation -> relation -> relation
  (** [natural_join post matches rel1 rel2] returns the natural join of
      relations [rel1] and [rel2], and maps [post] over the result. The
      parameter [matches] gives the columns which should match in the two
      relations in form of a list of tuples [(pos2,pos1)]: column [pos2] in
      [rel2] should match column [pos1] in [rel1].
